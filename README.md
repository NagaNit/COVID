The country reported its first three cases in Kerala, all of whom were students who had returned from Wuhan, China. The transmission escalated in the month of March, after several cases were reported all over the country, most of which were linked to people with a travel history to affected countries. On 10 March, the total cases reached 50. On 12 March, a 76-year-old man who had returned from Saudi Arabia became the first victim of the virus in the country. The total cases reached 100 on 15 March and 250 on 20 March.

Hey reviewer, the previous reviewer is saying I have copied from my own git repo which is (https://github.com/NagaNit) which is ridiculous and flagged me with plagiarism and he asked me to prove that's my account. Before Checking the plagiarism tool I would like to tell one thing, If you found any similar code matches with others like function, loops, assigning variables, and some visualization it is a complete coincidence.
